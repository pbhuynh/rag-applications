    "For the full context on the topic of this notebook, review the **Text2SQL** section of the [Week 3 Course Content](https://uplimit.com/course/rag-applications/session/session_clzlsa20a01di197e4tij7vgm/module/text2sql). \n",
    " \n",
    "This notebook will walk you through the process of creating a Text2SQL pipeline which will aid in expanding the number of total answerable questions by your RAG system.  This notebook will implement the following steps:\n",
    "- Create a `sqlite3` database and populate it with corpus metadata that we already have available in the `data/metadata` directory.\n",
    "- Import and train a Semantic Router for query routing.\n",
    "- Define system and user message prompts for creating a Text2SQL LLM call\n",
    "- Create a basic dataflow pipeline for the execution of a SQL query route"

Chichilnisky, the discussion centers on understanding visual perception and applying that knowledge to the development of neural prostheses to cure blindness. Dr. Chichilnisky, a professor at Stanford University, delves into the encoding of the visual world by neurons in the brain and the potential to engineer devices that can not only restore sight to the blind but also enhance memory and cognition. The conversation also explores the importance of choosing one's professional path, with Dr. Chichilnisky sharing his unconventional journey through science and how it shaped his focus on neuroscience and medicine. The episode emphasizes the significance of translating scientific understanding into practical applications that can improve lives.\n",

As discussed in the [course content](https://uplimit.com/course/rag-applications/v2/module/text2sql#corise_clwcz3wvy00212e6jwlnsxf1g), we have a few options for which type of Router that we want to use (Logical, Semantic, ML Classifier).

    "The following Class will implement the full Text2SQL flow, making use of the sqlite database that we created in Step 1 and the Semantic Router that we created and trained in Step 2.  I encourage you to walk through the functions in this Class to better understand how they work, and why they are being implemented.  A description of what each function does at a high level:\n",
    "- `text2sql`: Executes an LLM call that translates a natural language query into a SQL command\n",
    "- `reg_call`: Executes standard hybrid search call and returns top_k results.\n",
    "- `get_sql_db_reponse`: Takes the output from `text2sql` and queries the sqlite db with that SQL command\n",
    "- `parse_sql_response`: Takes the output from `get_sql_db_response` which is the raw answer from the sqlite db and passes it and the original natural language query as args to an LLM call which returns a human friendly response.  This step is not absolutely necessary and could be replaced by creating your own custom string that combines the original query and the raw sql response.\n",
    "- **`__call__`**: The call function puts everything together and follows this flow:\n",
    "  - Takes as input a `route` and a `query`.  The route is generated by the Semantic Router (either a sql route or regular route).\n",
    "  - First makes a regular call to Weaviate.  This is necessary for two reasons.  If the route if regular we need to make this call anyway.  If the route is miscategorized as SQL or if the SQL response is garbage, then we'll want the Reader LLM to have at least some backup context so that it can either effectively respond or state that it can't answer the question.\n",
    "  - If the route is \"sql\" then a chain of internal function calls are made in this order: `text2sql`, `get_sql_db_response`, and `parse_sql_response`.\n",
    "  - If the route is \"sql\" then the model is provided with both sets of context (answer from sql db and Weaviate) otherwise just the retrieved context from Weaviate is returned.\n",
    "  - For convenience `logger.info` statements are embedded in the call function so that you can interactively see the output of each call.  Feel free to remove. "

Rick Rubin is a world-renowned music producer, having worked with an enormous number of incredible artists, producing, for instance, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Beastie Boys, Jay-Z, Johnny Cash, Adele, Lady Gaga, Tom Petty, and of course, Slayer. This last year, Rick also authored his first book, which is a truly incredible exploration into the creative process. His book is entitled, The Creative Act, A Way of Being. Rick has appeared once before on the Huberman Lab podcast. And during that appearance, he offered to answer listeners and viewers' questions. Those questions were put in the comment section on YouTube, and we received thousands of them. So today, Rick answers your questions about the creative process. I also took note of the feedback that when Rick previously appeared on the Huberman Lab podcast, that perhaps I spoke a bit more than the audience would have preferred.\n",

And I don't mean just doing a sport for more than 40 years. I truly mean he has been at the forefront of skateboarding, developing new maneuvers, aka tricks, that include incredible feats like the 900, a 900 degree spin in the air, as well as numerous other maneuvers that have really pushed the entire sport forward. He's also completely popularized the sport through his video game and through his ambassadorship for skateboarding. In fact, few, if any, names are synonymous with skateboarding in the general public as Tony Hawk. And he is oh so deserved of that title because for more than 40 years, he has shown up as the consummate professional. He is kind, he is respectful, and he is completely committed to his craft.\n",

Today's episode is all about endurance and fat loss, that is, the specific protocols required to achieve the four different kinds of endurance and how to maximize fat loss. Dr. Andy Galpin, great to be back. Today, we're going to talk about endurance. And I'm very interested in this conversation because I, like many other people, strive to get a certain amount of cardiovascular work in each week, maybe a longish jog, maybe a swim, ride the bike, et cetera. But when I think about the word endurance, the idea that almost immediately comes to mind is about doing something for a long period of time repeatedly. But I have a feeling that there are other ways to trigger this adaptation that we call the endurance adaptation. So I'm excited to learn about that. I'm also excited to learn about the fuel systems in the body that allow for endurance and other modes of repeated activity.\n",

He then went on to found the Pacific Premier Group, which is a collection of psychiatrists and therapists who are expert in treating all types of psychiatric disorders and life stressors. Across the four episodes of this series on mental health, Dr. Conti teaches us about the structure of our own minds and how to think about our own minds as a way to enhance our mental health. He explains how our subconscious mind and our conscious mind interact to drive our emotions, our decision making and our behavior.\n"

    "I encourage you to implement this advanced RAG technique into your application.  There are several steps left undone for this method to work in practice, not the least of which is combining the contextual responses recieved from the two databases into a sensible format and passing on to the Reader LLM for final answer synthesis.  You could, of course, choose to bank on your Router always being right and the LLM always generating a translatable SQL query, in which case you wouldn't need to combine contexts as a backup plan.  But...we are working with Generative LLMs after all 😵‍💫.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You could also try using the LLM itself as the Router instead of using a Semantic Router.  Probably worth evaluating that approach through testing before actually implementing into your app; there's also the added latency from another LLM call to consider as well with this approach.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As a final reminder, we are in the business of **Information Retrieval**, meaning we want to enable our users to get the information they need as quickly and as accurately as possible.  This Text2SQL method is one example of being creative with your data that will enable your users to ask additional questions about the data that they would not otherwise have access to...."
